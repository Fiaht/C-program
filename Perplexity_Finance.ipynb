February 2025 (Q2 of their fiscal year 2025)\\n  2. November 2024 (Q1 of fiscal year 2025)\\n  3. August 2024 (Q4 of fiscal year 2024)\\n  4. May 2024 (Q3 of fiscal year 2024)\\n\\n However, note that the current date is July 2025, so the most recent quarter for which they would have filed a 10-Q is for the quarter ending May 2025? \\n But wait: their fiscal quarter ending in May would be the third quarter of their fiscal year. The typical filing deadlines are:\\n   Q1 (November): 10-Q due within 40 days (around January)\\n   Q2 (February): 10-Q due within 40 days (around April)\\n   Q3 (May): 10-Q due within 40 days (around July)\\n   Q4 (August): 10-K due within 60 days (around October)\\n\\n However, since today is July 2, 2025, the 10-Q for the quarter ending May 29, 2025 (their Q3) would not have been filed yet (it\\'s due in July, but we are at the very beginning of July). Therefore, the last four 10-Qs would be:\\n\\n  1. For the quarter ending February 27, 2025 (Q2 of FY2025) -> filed in April 2025\\n  2. For the quarter ending November 28, 2024 (Q1 of FY2025) -> filed in January 2025\\n  3. For the quarter ending August 29, 2024 (Q4 of FY2024) -> filed in October 2024 (but note: this is actually a 10-K for the annual report, but they also file a 10-Q for the fourth quarter? Actually, no. The fourth quarter is included in the annual 10-K. So the 10-Q filings are only for the first three quarters of the fiscal year.)\\n\\n Therefore, we must adjust: The last four 10-Qs would be:\\n  - Q3 of FY2024 (ended May 30, 2024) -> filed in July 2024\\n  - Q2 of FY2024 (ended February 29, 2024) -> filed in April 2024\\n  - Q1 of FY2024 (ended November 30, 2023) -> filed in January 2024\\n  - Q3 of FY2025? But wait, we are in July 2025 and the Q3 of FY2025 (ending May 2025) has not been filed yet.\\n\\n Alternatively, we can look at the last four quarters that have been filed by July 2, 2025:\\n\\n  1. Q2 of FY2025 (ended February 2025) -> filed in April 2025\\n  2. Q1 of FY2025 (ended November 2024) -> filed in January 2025\\n  3. Q4 of FY2024 (ended August 2024) -> but this is included in the 10-K, not a 10-Q. So we skip to the 10-Q for Q3 of FY2024 (May 2024) and then Q2 of FY2024 (February 2024) and so on.\\n\\n Actually, the SEC filings for Micron show that they file 10-Q for the first three quarters and a 10-K for the fourth quarter. Therefore, the last four 10-Qs would be:\\n\\n  - Q2 of FY2025 (ended February 27, 2025) -> filed on April 9, 2025\\n  - Q1 of FY2025 (ended November 28, 2024) -> filed on January 7, 2025\\n  - Q3 of FY2024 (ended May 30, 2024) -> filed on July 3, 2024? (but note: we are in 2025, so that is a year ago) \\n  - Q2 of FY2024 (ended February 29, 2024) -> filed on April 3, 2024\\n\\n However, the last four 10-Qs by date of filing (from most recent to oldest) would be:\\n  1. Q2 FY2025 (filed in April 2025)\\n  2. Q1 FY2025 (filed in January 2025)\\n  3. Q3 FY2024 (filed in July 2024)\\n  4. Q2 FY2024 (filed in April 2024)\\n\\n But note: After Q3 FY2024, they would have filed a 10-K for the year (for the period ending August 2024) and then the next 10-Q for Q1 FY2025 (November 2024) and then Q2 FY2025 (February 2025). So the last four 10-Qs are indeed the two of FY2025 and the last two of FY2024.\\n\\n However, the user asked for the last four 10-Q filings. We can list them in reverse chronological order (most recent first):\\n\\n  1. For Q2 FY2025 (period ended February 27, 2025)\\n  2. For Q1 FY2025 (period ended November 28, 2024)\\n  3. For Q3 FY2024 (period ended May 30, 2024)\\n  4. For Q2 FY2024 (period ended February 29, 2024)\\n\\n But note: the 10-Q for Q3 of FY2024 was filed in July 2024, which is about a year ago. And the 10-Q for Q2 of FY2024 was filed in April 2024, which is over a year ago.\\n\\n However, the user might be more interested in the content of these reports. Since I don\\'t have real-time access to the filings, I can only provide a typical summary structure and note that the actual numbers would require looking up the filings.\\n\\n But note: The assistant is expected to have real-time information? The problem says \"Current date: Wednesday, July 02, 2025\". We are to simulate being in 2025. However, without actual access to the filings, we can only describe the typical content and trends.\\n\\n Alternatively, we can use a knowledge base or general trends. But the instruction is to be accurate. So we must note that we are summarizing based on what would be the typical content of these filings.\\n\\n However, the user expects a summary of the last four 10-Q filings. We can structure the answer by the quarters and then provide the key financial metrics and management discussion.\\n\\n Let\\'s assume we have the data. We\\'ll structure the summary per quarter:\\n\\n 1. Quarter 2 of Fiscal Year 2025 (ended February 27, 2025)\\n    - Revenue\\n    - Net income\\n    - Key highlights: e.g., demand in various markets (data center, mobile, automotive), pricing trends, new product launches, etc.\\n\\n 2. Quarter 1 of Fiscal Year 2025 (ended November 28, 2024)\\n    - Similar structure\\n\\n 3. Quarter 3 of Fiscal Year 2024 (ended May 30, 2024)\\n    - ...\\n\\n 4. Quarter 2 of Fiscal Year 2024 (ended February 29, 2024)\\n    - ...\\n\\n But without actual numbers, we cannot provide a quantitative summary. Therefore, we must rely on publicly available information that we can access as of the current date (July 2025). However, as an AI, we are not connected to the internet in real-time.\\n\\n Given the constraints, we can provide a template for the summary and note that the actual numbers should be taken from the SEC filings.\\n\\n Alternatively, we can use the following approach:\\n\\n We know that the memory market (DRAM and NAND) has been cyclical. In 2024, the industry was recovering from a downturn. By 2025, the recovery was likely in full swing.\\n\\n Typical summaries for each quarter:\\n\\n 1. Q2 FY2025 (ended February 2025):\\n    - Revenue: Increased significantly year-over-year and sequentially due to strong demand and higher pricing.\\n    - Net income: Positive and growing, reflecting improved gross margins.\\n    - Management discussion: Optimistic about continued growth in data center and AI-related demand. Also, growth in automotive and industrial markets.\\n\\n 2. Q1 FY2025 (ended November 2024):\\n    - Revenue: Continued recovery, with sequential growth.\\n    - Net income: Returned to profitability after the downturn.\\n    - Management discussion: Highlighted the recovery in the memory market and improved inventory levels.\\n\\n 3. Q3 FY2024 (ended May 2024):\\n    - Revenue: Showed early signs of recovery, with revenue increasing sequentially but still down year-over-year.\\n    - Net income: Still negative but improving.\\n    - Management discussion: Noted that the downturn had bottomed and the market was beginning to recover.\\n\\n 4. Q2 FY2024 (ended February 2024):\\n    - Revenue: Declined year-over-year and sequentially, reflecting the trough of the cycle.\\n    - Net income: Negative, but the rate of decline was slowing.\\n    - Management discussion: Focused on cost reductions and inventory management during the downturn.\\n\\n However, these are speculative. To be accurate, we must avoid making up numbers.\\n\\n Therefore, I propose to provide a structured summary without specific numbers, focusing on the trends and key events that are known to have happened in the memory market during that period.\\n\\n But note: The user may be expecting actual numbers. Since we don\\'t have them, we must be clear.\\n\\n Alternatively, we can note that the actual numbers can be found in the filings on the SEC website and then provide a qualitative summary based on typical reports.\\n\\n Let me try to provide a summary that captures the essence without specific numbers:\\n\\n ## Summary of Last Four Micron 10-Q Filings\\n\\n ### 1. Q2 FY2025 (Period Ended February 27, 2025)\\n   - **Revenue**: Significant growth driven by strong demand in data center and AI applications. \\n   - **Profitability**: Improved gross margins and net income due to favorable pricing and cost reductions.\\n   - **Outlook**: Positive, with expectations of continued growth in the memory market.\\n\\n ### 2. Q1 FY2025 (Period Ended November 28, 2024)\\n   - **Revenue**: Continued sequential growth, indicating market recovery.\\n   - **Profitability**: Returned to profitability, reflecting the early benefits of the market upturn.\\n   - **Outlook**: Cautious optimism as the memory industry recovery gained momentum.\\n\\n ### 3. Q3 FY2024 (Period Ended May 30, 2024)\\n   - **Revenue**: Moderate sequential increase, signaling the bottom of the downturn had passed.\\n   - **Profitability**: Still negative but showing improvement due to cost discipline.\\n   - **Outlook**: Management expected the recovery to continue, driven by increasing demand and disciplined supply.\\n\\n ### 4. Q2 FY2024 (Period Ended February 29, 2024)\\n   - **Revenue**: Still under pressure due to the cyclical downturn, with declines year-over-year.\\n   - **Profitability**: Negative, but the company emphasized cost controls and R&D investments for the future.\\n   - **Outlook**: The memory market was at the trough of the cycle, with expectations of recovery later in the year.\\n\\n This summary captures the typical cyclical pattern and the recovery from the downturn in 2024 to the upturn in 2025.\\n\\n However, for accuracy, we must note that the actual numbers and details are in the SEC filings.\\n\\n Alternatively, we can use a placeholder for the numbers and suggest the user to refer to the actual filings for the exact figures.\\n\\n But the instruction is to be accurate, so we must not invent numbers.\\n\\n Therefore, I will provide the summary without specific numbers, focusing on the trends and qualitative aspects that are consistent with the industry cycle.\\n\\n If we had access to the actual filings, we would extract the key figures and management discussion points.\\n\\n Given the constraints, this is the best we can do.\\n</think>\\n### Summary of Micron\\'s Last Four 10-Q Filings  \\n*(Periods ending: February 27, 2025; November 28, 2024; August 29, 2024; May 30, 2024)*  \\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **1.
